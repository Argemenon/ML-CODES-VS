# OpenCV and Tkinter Learning Repository

Welcome to my OpenCV and Tkinter learning repository! This project documents my journey as i explore computer vison with OpenCV and GUI developement with Tkinter in Python. The end goal is to learn machine learning and impliment it to research in Physics.

## Objectives
+ Learn the basics of OpenCv for image processign and computer vison
+ Build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Tkinter.
+ Combine OpenCV and Tkinter to create interactive applications

## Tools and Technologies
+ Python and Jupyter notebooks
+ Python Libraries used:
    + OpenCV for image processing and computer vison tasks.
    + Tkinter for creating GUIs
